I designed my own deskmat since I couldn't find anything pink and Maplestory themed online that I liked. If you want another color to match your aesthetic, I have also included the Adobe Illustrator file.

## Deskmat printing information:
###### Deskmat printer company used:
- [**Specter Labs](https://specterlabs.co/collections/custom-mousepads/products/xxl-large-custom-mouse-pad)** (I have no relation to them, I have just used them to create deskmats for others as gifts and this is the highest quality one I've seen). They are pricey so feel free to use whoever, just ensure the resizing is okay.
###### Specs of deskmat
- **Size used:** XXL (I'm not sure if company will resize image for you but these deskmats were made for XXL which is 35.4″x15.7″) 
- **Thickness:** 4mm
###### How to clean
- Do **NOT** put your deskmat in the dryer, only washer and leave to **air dry**.
