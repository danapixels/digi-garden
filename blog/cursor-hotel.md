# Cursor Hotel Progress
Created June 8th, 2025

Cursor hotel is an MVP for a project I thought about when I visited Dimden.dev's website. I really enjoyed seeing another cursor on a webpage. We communicated by moving our cursor to the Discord link. 

I also had a similar non-verbal experience with Journey and through this project, maybe I can emulate a similar emotion with others.

Note: This is all coded with ChatGPT since I have 0 idea how to program. This will be reviewed by an actual engineer eventually. Credits to @Mshj for helping me.

Goal: A place to put your cursor when you AFK.
## Phase 1: Function

	- Program custom names
	- Program timer over cursor that indicates AFK time

	- Label for AFK timer
