# Cursor Hotel Progress
Created June 8th, 2025

Cursor hotel is an MVP for a project I thought about when I visited Dimden.dev's website. I really enjoyed seeing another cursor on a webpage. We communicated by moving our cursor to the Discord link. 

I also had a similar non-verbal experience with Journey and through this project, maybe I can emulate a similar emotion with others.

Goal: A place to put your cursor when you AFK.
