# Cursor Hotel Progress
Created June 8th, 2025

Cursor hotel is an MVP for a project I thought about when I visited Dimden.dev's website. I really enjoyed seeing another cursor on a webpage. We communicated by moving our cursor to the Discord link. 

I also had a similar non-verbal experience with Journey and through this project, maybe I can emulate a similar emotion with others.

Note: This is all coded with ChatGPT since I have 0 idea how to program. This will be reviewed by an actual engineer eventually. Credits to @Mshj for helping me.

Goal: A place to put your cursor when you AFK.
## Phase 1: Function
- ~~Set up live cursors~~ June 9th, 2025
	- ~~Program custom names~~
	- ~~Program timer over cursor that indicates AFK time~~
	- ~~Cursor should not show until you enter a name~~
- ~~Create webpage UI~~
	- ~~Create name page~~
		- I~~ntro text~~
		- ~~Button to connect~~
		- ~~Enter username~~
	- ~~Logo~~
	- ~~Label for name~~
	- ~~Label for AFK timer~~

Bug: Fix hover on purple
- Possibly due to browser
- Is it possible to allow only 1 connection per user?
## Phase 2: Actions
- Set up cursor actions
- ~~Fixed bug where label and afk timer move the cursor position~~
	- ~~Double click is a smiley face~~
		- ~~Redo animation and visual~~
	- ~~Click shows an echo effect~~
		- ~~Create animation~~
		- Fixed bug where clicking connect would show the effect.
	- ~~AFK timer show above cursors after 1 minute (last moved)~~
	- ~~On drag a line shows and disappears~~ Won't do this, might be too much with current actions.

## Phase 3: Fun
